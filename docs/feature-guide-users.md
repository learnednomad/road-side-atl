### Track Your Provider in Real Time

Once a provider is dispatched to your location, you see a live tracking map:

- Provider name, photo, and rating
- Real-time position on the map (updates every 30 seconds)
- Estimated distance from you
- Status updates as they progress (dispatched → en route → arrived → working)

You also receive SMS and push notification updates at each stage.

### Pay for Your Service

RoadSide ATL accepts multiple payment methods. The methods available to you depend on your **Trust Tier** (see below).

**All Customers:**

- **Cash** — Pay the provider directly at the time of service
- **CashApp** — Send payment to the business CashApp tag
- **Zelle** — Send payment to the business email

**Trusted Customers (Tier 2):**

- **Credit/Debit Card** — Pay online via Stripe during booking

For Cash, CashApp, and Zelle, an admin confirms your payment after the provider reports it. You receive a receipt by email once confirmed.

### Earn Trust Tier Status

New customers start at **Tier 1**, which limits payment to Cash, CashApp, or Zelle. This protects the platform from chargebacks.

**How to reach Tier 2:**

- Complete 3 services with successful payments (no disputes)
- Your account automatically upgrades to Tier 2
- You can then pay by credit or debit card through Stripe

You can view your current tier and clean transaction count on your dashboard.

### Refer a Friend and Earn Credits

Share your referral link and both you and your friend earn **$10.00 in credits**.

1. Go to your **Dashboard > Referrals** page
2. Copy your unique referral link or code
3. Share it with a friend
4. When your friend signs up and completes their first booking, you both receive $10.00

Your credits appear on your referral dashboard and can be used on your next booking.

### Use Referral Credits on a Booking

Apply your earned credits during checkout:

1. During the booking review step, you see your available credit balance
2. Toggle "Apply referral credits" to deduct from the total price
3. Credits reduce the amount you owe (down to $0 if you have enough)

Credits are applied after any pricing adjustments (time-block multipliers, towing surcharges).

### View Your Inspection Report

1. You receive an email with a link to your branded PDF report
2. The report includes:
   - Vehicle information

   - Categorized findings (engine, transmission, brakes, tires, etc.)
   - Condition ratings (good, fair, poor, critical)
   - OBD2 diagnostic codes
   - Measurements (tread depth, fluid levels, etc.)
   - Photos (if taken)
   - Overall pass/fail summary
3. Download the PDF for your records or share it

### Leave a Review

After your service is completed:

2. Select a star rating (1-5)
3. Optionally add a written comment
